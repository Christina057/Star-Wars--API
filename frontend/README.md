# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
## Step 2: Create a React App
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a new React app:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```
## Change the directory
```
cd my-app
```
## Run the App
```
npm start
```
This command will run the app in the development mode and open http://localhost:3000 in your default browser.
## Build the App for Production
```
npm run build
```
This command will create a build folder with the optimized production build of your app.
## Deploy the App
To deploy the app, you can use various hosting services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. Here's a general guide on how to deploy to GitHub Pages:

Create a GitHub repository for your project.

Run the following command to add a remote repository to your local project:
```
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
```
Push your project to GitHub:
```
git push -u origin master
```
```
npm run deploy
```
